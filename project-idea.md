# Meal Joiners (temporary name, because Lunch Buddy is already taken :D )

The idea behind this project is to get people that previously did not know each other to have lunch together

## The way this application works

- sign up :)
- add your preferred time of having lunch
- add your location
- decide, with whom you want to have lunch, depending on a list of keywords to chose from

## The application should then

- match you with someone who fits the previously chosen facts
- recommends a place to eat nearby
- sends an invitation to you and your match (you or your match can either accept or decline)
